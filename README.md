Automatic light control for arduino

This software was created in 2014 to control some external and internal lights using a photoresistor and some switches to change modes (Summer/Winter, Auto/Manual, etc...). It worked fine for the last few years, but the photoresistor wasn't really accurate.

I converted the software in 2018 to use the tsl2561 digital light sensor
