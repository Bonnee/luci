## Automatic light control for arduino
This software was created to control some external and internal lights using a photoresistor and some switches to change modes (Summer/Winter, Auto/Manual, etc...). It worked fine for the last few years, but the photoresistor was'n really accurate.

The 'tsl2561' branch contains my attempt to convert it to use a digital light sensor that can filter non visible light to improve accuracy.
